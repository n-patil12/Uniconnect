# Uniconnect
Tired of having so many different platforms and accounts to keep up with the various organizations and events on campus? UniConnect is a platform that brings students and university organizations together easier than ever before. With this examples in mind, our proposed impact is that we create an application that nurtures a safe, caring, and engaging environment among their peers and UIC-affiliated organizations. We hope that through this application, this can be used for multiple universities, especially our sister branches: University of Illinois and University of Illinois Springfield, in order to extend towards a larger audience that students can engage with.
